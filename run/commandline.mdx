Most DB vendors - although not all - support some sort of SQL command line tool.  They are quite different from each other, and are somewhat difficult to support for a general-purpose, heterogenous DB product.

To get around this problem, Wirekite implemented a simple SQL command line tool.  The cmdline tool uses the same DSN or URL files for connecting that other Wirekite tools use.  If you can connect to a database using the cmdline tool, the same DSN/URL file will work for connecting with other Wirekite tools.

## Using the cmdline tool

Here's an example of connecting and running the cmdline tool using Firebolt.

```shellscript
$ ./cmdline -d firebolt -c fi_url.txt
firebolt instance connect successful
=> \h
\i filename          - load a file of SQL statments
\o [filename]        - write output to filename - \o [no-file] disables
\d csv|list          - change display format
\p <num>             - change number of rows per page: 0=no paging
\r true|false        - show row numbers
\t                   - toggle show time
\D                   - print current display settings
\h                   - print this help info
\c value-enclose-char value-separator-char row-end-char show-header:true|false
CSV format spec chars can be QUOTE, DOUBLEQUOTE, COMMA, SPACE, PIPE, NONE, NEWLINE, CRLF, other literals
<ctrl>-D              - exit
=> create table example (a int, b int);
ok
=> insert into example values (1,1),(2,2),(3,3);
ok
=> select * from example;
1: a: 1
1: b: 1
2: a: 2
2: b: 2
3: a: 3
3: b: 3
=> \d csv
display type set to csv
=> select * from example;
'a','b'
'1','1'
'2','2'
'3','3'
=> bye
```
## cmdline tool Usage Details
```shellscript
cmdline -d dbtype -c file-containing-conn-info.txt
```
Valid dbtypes include:

- firebolt
- mysql
- oracle
- snowflake
- sqlserver

## cmdline tool Notes

- We are working on PostgreSQL support, but its psql tool should be used there.
- Some database/sql drivers used by the cmdline tool print spurious log messages upon registration. These can be ignored.
- Embedded semicolons in SQL string literals or comments are not yet supported.
