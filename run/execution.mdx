## Orchestrator

Wirekite has a main binary called the orchestrator. The actual binary is called wirekite. This is a top level binary which calls all the other binaries to execute the task of data movement. Note that other binaries can be called independently also for testing purposes.

## Orchestrator Configuration File

Orchestrator takes a configuration file to understand what needs to be done. The configuration file has the following rules.

1. The configuration variables can be represented using the format `variable=value`.
2. Empty lines are allowed.
3. Comments are allowed. To comment just start the line with #.
4. Multilevel variables are allowed using the format `parent.child=value`.

## Variables

The confguration file has the following variables and allowed values to determine what needs to be done.

<ResponseField name="source" type="string">
  source is the database type from which we are extracting. The possible values are

  1. mysql
  2. oracle
  3. postgres
  4. sqlserver
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="target" type="string">
  target is the database type to which we are loading. The possible values are

  1. snowflake
  2. firebolt
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="mode" type="string">
  mode defines what exactly are you moving from the source to the target. The possible values are

  1. schema
  2. data
  3. change
</ResponseField>

Schema means that we are extracting the schema of the source database. Note that the schema is not automatically executed on the target database. This is done manually because we probably want to make some granular changes to the schema properties on the target database.

Data means we are extracting data from the source database and loading on the target database. This is done automatically by the orchestrator.

Change means that we are extracting changes -- Inserts, Updates , Deletes , Begins, Commits -- from the source database to the target database. This is done automatically by the orchestrator. Orchestrator can run infinitely continuously updating data in the target from the source.

## Source Child Variables

Both `source` and `target` variables can have child variables. The child variables are always represented as `source.variable=value`. The child variables can vary depending upon what is the source.

For example if the source=mysql then the child variables can be any of the variables listed in [mysql variables](/sourceguides/mysql) but if the source is oracle then the variables need to be [oracle variables](/sourceguides/oracle).

## Target Child Variables

Just like source can have child variables target can also have child variables. And similarly the target child variables depends upon the target.

For example if the target=snowflake then the child variables can be any of the variables listed in [snowflake variables](/targetguides/snowflake).

However target child variables have a slightly more expanded syntax. Target usually has two components -- a loader and a mover. A loader essentially loads the files on to the target database while a mover actually moves the files from source to the target. Both loader and mover can take configuration variables specific to them.

To distinguish between the variables for loader and mover the syntax that we use is `target.loader.variable=value` and `target.mover.variable=value`.

For example the if the target= firebolt you can see both loader and mover variables in [firebolt variables](/targetguides/firebolt).

## Bringing It All Together

So how does a complete orchestrator configuration file looks like. Here's an example

```shellscript
# Example orchestrator configuration file

# main 
source=mysql
target=firebolt
mode=data

# source
source.outputDirectory=/mnt/benchmark/dumpdir
source.tablesFile=/home/ziggy/wk/tables.txt
source.dsnFile=/home/ziggy/wk/my.dsn
source.logFile=/home/ziggy/wk/change_extractor.log
source.maxThreads=10
source.maxRowsPerDump=100000
source.hexEncoding=false

# target loader
target.loader.dsnFile=/home/ziggy/wirekite/benchmark/urlfiles/fi_url.txt
target.loader.awsBucket=fireboltgregtest
target.loader.logFile=/home/ziggy/wk/data_loader.log
target.loader.schemaFile=/home/ziggy/wirekite/benchmark/firenibble.scm
target.loader.awsRegion=us-east-1
target.loader.awsCredentialsFile=/home/ziggy/benchmark/aws_creds.txt
target.loader.dataFileExtension=dkt
target.loader.maxThreads=10
target.loader.hexEncoding=false
target.loader.removeFiles=true
target.loader.countRows=false

# target mover
target.mover.maxThreads=10
target.mover.removeFiles=true
target.mover.awsRegion=us-east-1
target.mover.dataDirectory=/mnt/benchmark/dumpdir
target.mover.sourceFileExtension=dkt
target.mover.gzipFiles=false
target.mover.awsBucket=fireboltgregtest
target.mover.logFile=/home/ziggy/wk/data_mover.log
```
