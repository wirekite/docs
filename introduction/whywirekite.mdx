## Why Wirekite

Since the advent of computers data has been a very critical component of the infrastructure and technologies have been evolving ever since then to store and retrieve data in a performant container while keeping low costs. We have seen the rise of RDBMS databases, NoSQL databases and now we are in the era of Cloud databases that promise infinite scalability and elasticity. &#x20;

Part of the problem is moving this data from one platform to another. Given that data volumes have exploded and applications have significantly shorter down times and SLAs, this problem has become the brunt of failures of most data migration projects.&#x20;

Wirekite solves this problem.&#x20;

When you need your data in the target database as fast as possible look no further. Imagine you have a database of 10 TB and a data migration platform that moves data at 1 GB per second, you will take approx 2.8 hours to transfer the data. If the rate is amped up to 10GB per second, it will take 17 minutes to move the same amount of data. Now imagine if the rate is 100GB per second, you can do the migration in 1.7 minutes. Imagine the impact on application downtime going from 2.8 hours to 17 minutes to 1.7 minutes.&#x20;

<Note>
  **Wirekite reduces application downtime from hours to minutes.**

Note that wirekite is not doing a simple movement of bits but a complicated transition of bits from one database platform to another.&#x20;
