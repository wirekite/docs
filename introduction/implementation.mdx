## Wirekite Components&#x20;

As we understood in the previous section, wirekite has 3 entities -- schema, data and change -- and 3 components -- extractor, mover and loader. The entities are the objects in the database that wirekite works upon, while components are the operators that work on the entities.&#x20;

Lets put these all together and we get a sequence in which all the components work on the entities to ultimately establish a target database which is continuosuly updated from the source database.  &#x20;

The sequence that is to be followed in a real production infrastructure is as follows.  &#x20;

## Sequence&#x20;

The following architectural diagram explains how data will be migrated to a target database and how a replication pipeline will be established from source to target database.
