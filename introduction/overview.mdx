## What is Wirekite

Wirekite is a essentially a fast (probably the fastest) cross database, dump, load and replication platform. To break down the definition wirekite is&#x20;

* Fast - We boast ourselves in being extremely fast.

<Note>
  Wirekite is 10x - 100k faster than competitors.
</Note>

* Cross Database - Wirekite allows you to move data from Postgres, MySQL and Oracle to multiple cloud databases. For now we are supporting Cloud versions of MySQL and Postgres and Snowflake. We will be adding more Cloud targets in future.&#x20;

* Dump, Load - Wirekite to allows you to dump and load data from source databases. Part of any data migration (whether one time or ongoing) involves taking an initial dump of data and moving it to the target. Wirekite prides itself in moving copious amounts of data (TBs / PBs) in much shorter time frames than other technologies.

* Replication - In addition to moving large data, wirekite allows you to keep the data on the target fresh from the source. This helps enormously with doing an application switch over from source to target while affording relatively small downtime.&#x20;

## Why Wirekite

Since the advent of computers data has been a very critical component of the infrastructure and technologies have been evolving ever since then to store and retrieve data in a performant container while keeping low costs. We have seen the rise of RDBMS databases, NoSQL databases and now we are in the era of Cloud databases that promise infinite scalability and elasticity. &#x20;

Part of the problem is moving this data from one platform to another. Given that data volumes have exploded and applications have significantly shorter down times, this problem has become the brunt of failures of most data migration projects.&#x20;

<Note>
  60% of data migration projects fail.
</Note>

Wirekite solves this problem. When you need your data in the target database as fast as possible look no further. Imagine you have a database of 10 TB and a data migration platform that moves data at 1 GB per second, you will take approx 2.8 hours to transfer the data. If the rate is amped up to 10GB per second, it will take 17 minutes to move the same amount of data. Now imagine if the rate is amped up to 100GB per second, you can do the migration in 1.7 minutes.

Imagine the impact on downtime going from 2.8 hours to 17 minutes to 1.7 minutes. Note that wirekite is not doing a simple movement of bits but a complicated transition of bits from one database platform to another.&#x20;
