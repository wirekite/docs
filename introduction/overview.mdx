## What is Wirekite

Wirekite is a essentially a fast (probably the fastest) cross database, dump, load and replication platform. To break down the definition wirekite is&#x20;

* Fast - We pride ourselves in being extremely fast.

<Note>
  **Wirekite is 10x-100x faster than its competitors.**
</Note>

* Cross Database - Wirekite allows you to move data from Postgres, MySQL and Oracle to multiple cloud databases. For now we are supporting Cloud versions of MySQL and Postgres and Snowflake. We will be adding more Cloud targets in future.&#x20;

* Dump, Load - Wirekite to allows you to dump and load data from source databases. Part of any data migration (whether one time or ongoing) involves taking an initial dump of data and moving it to the target. Wirekite prides itself in moving copious amounts of data (TBs / PBs) in much shorter time frames than other technologies.

* Replication - In addition to moving large data, wirekite allows you to keep the data on the target fresh from the source. This helps enormously with doing an application switch over from source to target while affording relatively small downtime.&#x20;

## Why Wirekite

Since the advent of computers data has been a very critical component of the infrastructure and technologies have been evolving ever since then to store and retrieve data in a performant container while keeping low costs. We have seen the rise of RDBMS databases, NoSQL databases and now we are in the era of Cloud databases that promise infinite scalability and elasticity. &#x20;

Part of the problem is moving this data from one platform to another. Given that data volumes have exploded and applications have significantly shorter down times and SLAs, this problem has become the brunt of failures of most data migration projects.&#x20;

Wirekite solves this problem.&#x20;

When you need your data in the target database as fast as possible look no further. Imagine you have a database of 10 TB and a data migration platform that moves data at 1 GB per second, you will take approx 2.8 hours to transfer the data. If the rate is amped up to 10GB per second, it will take 17 minutes to move the same amount of data. Now imagine if the rate is 100GB per second, you can do the migration in 1.7 minutes. Imagine the impact on application downtime going from 2.8 hours to 17 minutes to 1.7 minutes.&#x20;

<Note>
  **Wirekite reduces application downtime from hours to minutes.**
</Note>

Note that wirekite is not doing a simple movement of bits but a complicated transition of bits from one database platform to another.&#x20;

## Use Cases

There can be a multitude of reasons that data needs to be moved from one databases platform to another. But the most common reasons that it happens are the following

* Migration of application and or database from one platform to another.&#x20;

* Permanent pipelines from one database to another typically from an OLTP database to a Data Warehouse or Analytics database. &#x20;

Wirekite helps with both.

Lets talk about both cases in a bit more detail.

### Application Migration 

Sooner or later you will encounter a scenario where you will have to migrate your application to a new platform. This is very common these days since many firms are migrating their whole infrastructure to the cloud. Migrating a production application to the cloud will have one very firm constraint - downtime. Wirekite makes sure that your downtime is minimal.

Furthermore your technical committee might decide to write an "interm" application that migrates the data, in small chunks, in a continuous fashion to the new data store. This poses a multitude of problems since now you have to keep track of how much data has been migrated and possibilities of drift between the two data stores. Wirekite frees your from all the vulnerabilities of writing such interim infrastrcuture. 

A much better approach would be to migrate the data to the new data store, while also making sure that the new data store is continuously replicated from the source with a minimal lag. Once this design is in place all you have to do is switchove the application to work on the new data store. Wirekite thrives in creating such an infrastructure. 

### Data Warehouse Pipelines

A mature data infrastrcuture usually has two components - A production OLTP database which serves the production application, and a secondary Data Warehouse / Analytics database which can be used by the analytic applications. 

The two databases usually have vastly different schemas and hence there are ETL pipelines going from OLTP to DW. ETL pipelines come with a variety of disadvantages causing delays in the arrival of data in the data warehouse, thus preventing quick analysis of data to make relevant decisions. Fairly recently we are seeing the advent of ELT pipelines where the loading is done first allowing the analysis of data to occur sooner the later. 

Wirekite allows the "loading" component of the data to be order of magnitude faster and also allows the loaded data to be updated with the source data with a lag of few seconds.
