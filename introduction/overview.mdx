## What is Wirekite

Wirekite is a essentially a fast (probably the fastest) cross database, dump, load and replication platform. To break down the definition wirekite is&#x20;

* Fast - We boast ourselves in being anywhere between **10x - 100x faster** than our nearest competitors.&#x20;

* Cross Database - Wirekite allows you to move data from Postgres, MySQL and Oracle to multiple cloud databases. For now we are supporting Cloud versions of MySQL and Postgres and Snowflake. We will be adding more Cloud targets in future.&#x20;

* Dump, Load - Wirekite to allows you to dump and load data from source databases. Part of any data migration (whether one time or ongoing) involves taking an initial dump of data and moving it to the target. Wirekite prides itself in moving copious amounts of data (TBs / PBs) in much shorter time frames than other technologies.

* Replication - In addition to moving large data, wirekite allows you to keep the data on the target fresh from the source. This helps enormously with doing an application switch over from source to target while affording relatively small downtime.&#x20;
